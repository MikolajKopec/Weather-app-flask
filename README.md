This is a small flask app, maked by using flask with weather api to get current weather in different cities.

There you can get you api key = https://openweathermap.org/api

To start the app you need to:
  1. Download the project
  2. Get api key from website above and paste it in "website/view.py" in "API_KEY='insert_here'" - line 6.
  3. Run main.py

App don't have many functionality. I wanted to make it simple and quite fancy look with actual weather in the city.
